# Tic-Tac-Toe Rust

This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic game "Tic-Tac-Toe" written in Rust. The game is played on a 3x3 board between two players, who take turns marking their symbol ('X' or 'O') on the board. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

## Installation

Before running this game, make sure you have Rust installed in your system. If not, you can download it from [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

To download the game, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/miguelgargallo/tictactoe-rust
```

## Usage

Navigate to the game's directory:

```bash
cd tictactoe-rust
```

Run the game:

```bash
cargo run
```

The game board is a 3x3 grid, represented as follows:

```bash
  1 2 3
A . . .
B . . .
C . . .
```

Each cell in the grid is identified by a combination of a letter (A, B, C) and a number (1, 2, 3). For example, the top left cell is A1, the middle cell is `A1`, and the middle cell is `B2`, and so on.

When it's your turn, enter your move in the format `A1`, `B3`, `C2`, etc. The program will prompt you for your input.
