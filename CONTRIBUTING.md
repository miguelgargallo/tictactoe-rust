Contributing to this project mainly involves submitting pull requests and managing forks. Here is a brief explanation of how you can do so:

## Forking the Repository

Before you can make a pull request, you'll need to create a fork of the repository. A fork is basically a copy of the repository that is saved in your own GitHub account.

Here's how you can fork the repository:

1. Navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. Click the `Fork` button in the top-right of the page.
3. Select the account where you want to create the fork.

Once you've created a fork, you can clone the forked repository to your local machine and start making changes.

## Submitting a Pull Request

After you've made your changes in your forked repository, you can submit a pull request to the original repository. Here are the steps to do so:

1. Navigate to the main page of your forked repository.
2. Click the `New pull request` button.
3. Ensure that the `base` repository is the repository you want to submit the pull request to.
4. Review the proposed changes and click `Create pull request`.
5. Provide a title and a description for your pull request.
6. Click `Create pull request`.

The maintainers of the original repository will review your pull request and decide whether to merge your changes. You might also need to resolve any merge conflicts that arise.

Please remember to follow any contributing guidelines provided by the project. This includes adhering to coding style guides, including appropriate tests for your code if necessary, and ensuring that your changes do not break any existing functionality.
